# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on social media data to understand public opinion on climate change. By processing and analyzing textual data, the project aims to reveal sentiment trends and provide insights into the general attitude toward climate change topics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Social media posts related to climate change (e.g., from Kaggle or a custom-collected dataset)
- **Description**: Includes text data and metadata (e.g., date, user info) from posts discussing climate change.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Removed stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant characters.
- **Tokenization & Normalization**: Converted text to lowercase, tokenized, and applied stemming/lemmatization.
- **Vectorization**: Transformed text into numerical data using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of sentiment scores across posts.
- Visualized sentiment trends over time.
- Identified frequently occurring keywords associated with positive or negative sentiment.

## Modeling
- **Approach**: Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis.
- **Tools**: Employed libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, or spaCy for sentiment scoring.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy and F1-score for classification.

## Results
- Detected clear trends in public sentiment regarding climate change.
- Provided insights that could inform communication and policy strategies.
